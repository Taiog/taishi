  "lsf.text1.1": "The LSF consists of a rational construction method, which features a structure consisting of thin galvanized steel profiles, cold formed and used in the structural and non-structural components of the building. Following the guidelines of the Brazilian Standard - NBR 15253:2014, the steel coils used in the manufacture must be coated with zinc or aluminum-zinc alloy by the continuous hot immersion process.",
  "lsf.text1.2": "The protection with zinc, of the profiles, has as objective, to avoid the corrosion of the steel, being able to use it in areas with the class of high aggressiveness, as for example, coastal areas.",
  "lsf.text1.3": "LSF is not just about structures. The system is divided into several components and “subsystems”, they are: structural, foundation, thermoacoustic insulation, internal and external closing, electrical and hydraulic installations. In order for the construction to reach its desired performance, these subsystems must be correctly harmonized and the materials used are ideal for each situation, thus, the choice of materials and labor directly influence the delivery time of the service.",
  "lsf.text1.4": "The steel profile manufacturing process used in the LSF system is mechanical, being molded at room temperature from steel coils, and its yield strength (fy) must be greater than 230 MPa, for profiles whose function is structural. , according to the recommendations of NBR 15253:2014. The thickness of the profiles used in the LSF varies between 0.8mm to 3mm.",
  "lsf.text1.5": "The standard width of the profiles used in the LSF for mullions, using the Ue profile, is 90 mm, 140 mm and 200mm, while for guides, using the U profile, the widths indicated by the standard are 92mm, 142mm and 202mm. The profiles can have other dimension variations, as long as the structural design meets the criteria required by NBR 14762.",
  "lsf.text2.1": "The steel profile manufacturing process used in the LSF system is mechanical, being molded at room temperature from steel coils, and its yield strength (fy) must be greater than 230 MPa, for profiles whose function is structural. , according to the recommendations of NBR 15253:2014. The thickness of the profiles used in LSF varies between 0.8mm to 3mm.",
  "lsf.text2.2": "The standard width of the profiles used in the LSF for mullions, using the Ue profile, is 90 mm, 140 mm and 200mm, while for guides, using the U profile, the widths indicated by the standard are 92mm, 142mm and 202mm. The profiles can have other dimension variations, as long as the structural design meets the criteria required by NBR 14762.",
  "lsf.text3.1": "When it comes to foundations in LSF, the great advantage is the savings generated by the low self-weight of the structure, when compared to the most used construction methods. For most residential constructions, shallow foundations such as raft or flat footing are used. The foundation is executed normally as in any other construction method, care must be taken to carry out a good waterproofing to avoid pathological manifestations due to the presence of moisture in the structure.",
  "lsf.text4.1": "The anchoring of the panels to the foundation takes place in two stages, first a temporary fixing is made just for the positioning of the panel in the correct place, after the positioning of the other panels that make up the structure of the walls, the panels are then aligned in plumb and square, soon after, the definitive fixation is made by means of anchor bolts, whether mechanical or chemical.",
  "lsf.text4.2": "Among the mechanical anchors, there is the option for special screws for concrete that make the fixing in a simple way, presenting greater load and resistance, and can be reused without losing its characteristics.",
  "lsf.text5.1": "Being the vertical closure, the system that makes up the internal and external walls of a building, in LSF the closing materials follow the concepts of low own weight and dry work. Another concept followed is the rationalization of fences, seeking a greater degree of industrialization. The modulation of the structure must be designed aiming at the optimization with the closures, the plates applied, have mostly a width of 1.20m, multiple of the modulation 400mm or 600mm.",
  "lsf.text5.2": "In the image above we can see a type of composition for the LSF wall. In it, we can observe that the plasterboard is used internally, as it is used in Drywall, a system already known by Brazilians.",
  "lsf.text5.3": "Among the steel profiles, we have the application of an insulating material, which can be: glass wool, rock wool, PET wool, or another material that guarantees thermal and acoustic insulation, the most used being the aforementioned.",
  "lsf.text5.4": "The first layer on the outside of the wall is the waterproof barrier, also called a waterproofing blanket, this component is like a fabric that wraps the entire facade of the building, not allowing water to pass through, but allowing water vapor to escape from inside. outside the building, this results in no accumulation of moisture inside the environment.",
  "lsf.text5.5": "After the water-repellent blanket, we have the cement slab, its application requires that they be left together between the slabs, which are then treated with a fiberglass tape and a specific mortar. With the treated joints, the basecoat is then applied, which is a cementitious mortar that together with a fiberglass screen serves as a base for the finish.",
  "lsf.text6.1": "The floor structure, also made of galvanized profiles, are mounted horizontally and must obey the modulation of the uprights. The profiles that make up the floor beams are part of the base that will receive the materials that form the subfloor.",	
  "lsf.text7.1": "The system allows architectural freedom and solutions for the roofs of buildings, regardless of the style adopted, whether flat roof or pitched roof, the versatility of LSF covers all forms. For pitched roofs, the composition similar to conventional construction, but using galvanized profiles instead of wood. Freedom is maintained in choosing the tiles that will be used on the roof, which can be of any material.",
  "lsf.text8.1": "The use of the facilities does not undergo any changes in design and dimensioning; the materials used can be the same as those applied to the masonry. Whether sanitary facilities, telephone, electricity, TV or solar heating, it is not necessary to adapt the path or loss of load because it is a building in LSF. Care should only be taken regarding the support and mounting for fixing, as the walls do not have mass inside.",
  "lsf.text8.2": "It is clear that the entire system installation procedure becomes more practical when compared to the conventional system. There is no need for holes in the wall to pass pipes, leaving the service cleaner. The complete visualization of the installation allows the early identification of interferences between systems, also allowing to test the systems before closing the wall. Already in use, when maintenance is required, it repeats the advantages of the construction phase, making the service practical and clean to do.",

  "sobre.quemSomos": "Taishi is a company from Sergipe, which was born from the desire for change, with the aim of positively impacting the state's civil construction sector, bringing an efficient, sustainable and high quality constructive model. Civil engineer Mayra Shimonishi and civil engineer Tiago Guerra founded the company in November 2021, thus taking the first step in pursuit of the dream.",
  "sobre.quemSomos2": "Taishi is a Japanese word that derives from two others: \"Tai\" and \"Shi\", the first has the meaning \"Great\", the second \"will\", together they assume the translation into English: \"Will to accomplish something great\" . But the choice of name goes beyond the simple translation. The choice of a Japanese name is related to the experience of engineer Mayra Shimonishi, granddaughter of Japanese, she lived 18 years in the Land of the Rising Sun, and has Japanese as her mother tongue.",
